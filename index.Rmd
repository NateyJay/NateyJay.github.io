I'm a recent Ph.D. in Plant Biology at Penn State, working with [Mike Axtell](https://sites.psu.edu/axtell/). My work has largely involved small-RNA-sequencing data, both in the context of tool development as well as exploring their interesting role in parasitic plants. 

I'm interested in many aspects of plant biology with a focus on evolution and genomics. I'm currently looking for positions where I can explore these interests and gain new skills in the quickly expanding realm of bioinformatics.
