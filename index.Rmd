Computational plant biologist interested in small RNAs and their role in inter-species competition. 

Currently, I'm finishing my Ph.D. in Plant Biology at Penn State, working with [Mike Axtell](https://sites.psu.edu/axtell/). I'm broadly interested in plant biology and currently looking for positions where I can use sequencing data and modern analysis techniques to better understand how plants function and interact with the world.
